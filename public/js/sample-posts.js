        title: 'Trying Out Oil Pastels',
        author: 'Zainab Ahmed',
        content: "I've been wanting to try out oil pastels for a while now, and I finally got my hands on some. I already love painting and sketching, so I thought it would be a fun challenge to try something new. I have been using the oil pastels for a few days now, and I have to say, I am really enjoying it. It does get really messy, but I like feeling like a kid again, finger-painting without a care for the mess. I love the organic feel of oil pastels and how easily they blend. So far I've painted some landscapes, but I want to try still-life soon!"

        title: "Exploring Alaska with My Family",
        author: 'Zainab Ahmed',
        content: "Last summer, my family and I went on a cruise to Alaska. It was a really fun experience, and I learned a lot about the culture, people, animals there. It was especially fun orca watching with everyone on the ship. My favorite city we visited was definitely Skagway since we went on a train that took us up and through the mountains. It was truly the most beautiful thing I have ever experienced. It kinda felt like I was on the Hogwarts Express."

        title: 'Getting Back Into Biking',
        author: 'Zainab Ahmed',
        content: "I love biking since its a great way to get some exercise and enjoy nature at the same time! Since the weather is getting warmer, I've been biking more. So far, I've biked at the Botanical Gardens and local forest preserves, but I hope to explore more trails this summer. I do need a new bike though, I've been using my dad's old bike these days and definitely need to go buy a new one."

        author: 'Zainab Ahmed',    
        content: "I'm no cook, but I've been seeing a lot of easy recipe videos that I've been trying out and they're actually edible for once! Cooking's actually quite fun when you've got the kitchen to yourself and got a banger playlist on. Some easy recipes I've been making are the Gigi Hadid pasta, Korean beef bulgogi, butter chicken, and chicken quesadillas."
